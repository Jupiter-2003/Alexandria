A sample responsive webpage having a navbar, cards, svg and a footer. Just a project to learn using CSS and Bootstrap effectively.

There is a transform property which adds a smooth underline animation to the navbar options on hovering. There is also a dropdown menu on hovering over "About". Also, I've used the svg wave generator from https://getwaves.io/ for some cool designs.
